Program Description

In this Project, i designed and implemented a special templated queue
abstract data type (ADT). 
Used Linked-list based implementation. 

It support all the standard functions of a queue. 
In addition, it also support a special function min() in constant time, i.e. O(1).
Thisfunction returns reference of the minimum element.
I used constant amount of extra memory. Enqueue and dequeue are also be O(1). 


The queue add vegetable and fruit items(given in the files)
To compare two fruits or vegetables, I used their calorie value (to implement min function). 

Modified queue is given in file sQueue.hpp.

The interface will look like->

	1. Remove element
	2. Show minimum
	3. Show all element
	4. Add element
	5. Enter 99 to exit
