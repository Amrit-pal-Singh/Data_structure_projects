Program Description
In this assignment, you need to design and implement a special templated queue
abstract data type (ADT). It should support all the standard functions of a queue. In
addition, it should also support a special function min() in constant time, i.e. O(1). This
function returns reference of the minimum element. You are allowed to use constant
amount of extra memory. Note that enqueue and dequeue should also be O(1). Use
linked-list based implementation.


The queue should be implemented such that the vegetable and fruit items of
Grocery-Store-Mangement-System can also be added to the queue. You are allowed to use the classes you
designed in the previous assignment for this. To compare two fruits or vegetables, you
can use their calorie value (to implement min function). You may need to write an
overloaded comparison function. You are allowed to take this as a global function.
The interface of the modified queue is given in file sQueue.hpp.
Your main program should take the fruits.txt or vegetables.txt as input, and depending
the the type of input file, it should add all the items to the the queue (using enqueue
function). The interface should allow users to remove elements from the queue and
view minimum.
