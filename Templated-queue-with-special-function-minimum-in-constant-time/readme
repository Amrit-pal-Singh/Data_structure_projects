Program Description

In this Project, i designed and implemented a special templated queue ADT. 
Used Linked-list based implementation. 

It support all the standard functions of a queue. 
In addition, it also support a special function min() in constant time, i.e. O(1).
I used constant amount of extra memory. Enqueue and dequeue are also be O(1). 


The queue add vegetable and fruit items(given in the files)
To compare two fruits or vegetables, it use their calorie value. 



Modified queue is given in file sQueue.hpp.

The interface will look like->

	1. Remove element
	2. Show minimum
	3. Show all element
	4. Add element
	5. Enter 99 to exit
